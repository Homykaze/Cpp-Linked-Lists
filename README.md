# Custom Linked Lists in C++
Getting to know pointers gave me a great insight to implementing custom data structures, such as Linked Lists, Binary Trees, and even more spohisticated ones. This repository contains my recursively implemented basic functions as well as non-recursive implementations of same or similar functions for single-pointer linked list data structure. Most of the functions can also be implemented non-recursively, however, their logic will redundantly be more complex.

Linked lists are naturally recursive, as each node points to another, smaller linked list, which allows us to solve problems with them recursively, splitting a problem into simpler subproblems until we hit a base case, which is what recursion is all about.

Writing my own data structures was a great practice to work with pointers, recursion, and algorithms. I learned about linked lists in the beginning of 2020, but I am uploading and reviewing my old code only now, some basic comments are there to show where we work with a base case or a recursive case. The code itself shouldn't be too complicated to understand the logic of each function.
